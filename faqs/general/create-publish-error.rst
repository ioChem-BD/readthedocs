Publication fails with: ' There has been an error retrieving Browse collection structure'...
=============================================================================================

It can happen the first time we try to publish our calculations in ioChem-BD .

If this message appears:

.. figure:: /imgs/create-publish-error.png
   :alt:   Missing endpoint where to publish error
   
   Missing endpoint where to publish error

   

It is indicating that the user has no communities on the Browse module where to publish to.

You have to contact your ioChem-BD administrator and request:

1. To `generate a community`_ where to publish your calculations (if it doesnâ€™t already exists),
2. then `add the user`_ to the community as administator.

.. _generate a community: ../../guides/installation/publishing-endpoints-definition.html
.. _add the user: ../../guides/installation/publishing-endpoints-definition.html#assign-community-publishers
