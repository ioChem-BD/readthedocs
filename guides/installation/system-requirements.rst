  -  A multicore CPU (1 GHz or better) is advised to allow multiuser interaction without bottlenecks or delays in calculation data extraction and manipulation.
  -  4 Gb RAM (8 Gb recommended)
  -  At least +20 Gb of free disk space (ioChem-BD installation takes 1.2Gb of disk space, so the remaining Gb are reserved for storing uploaded calculations).

Software requirements
